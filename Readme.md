Special thanks to [Andrew Gibiansky](http://andrew.gibiansky.com) for
[code inspirations](https://github.com/gibiansky/experiments) and [Gabriele Di Bari](https://github.com/Gabriele91) for his support.

This implementation of Neural Random-Access Machines ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06392.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06392.pdf)) does not contains any learning algorithm, so don't use it for this scope.
His only purpose is to test a pre-instructed neural network generated with [DENN-LITE](https://github.com/Gabriele91/DENN-LITE) over a specific task.

Anyway almost all the NRAM aspects are implemented, the only things missing out are cost calculation (that it is in progress, but not useful for this scope) and some plotting functions.
