Special thanks to [Andrew Gibiansky](http://andrew.gibiansky.com) for code inspirations.

This implementation does not contains any learning algorithm.
His only purpose is to test a pre-instructed neural network over a specific task.

By the way almost all the NRAM aspects are implemented, the only thing missing is cost calculation (in progress).
